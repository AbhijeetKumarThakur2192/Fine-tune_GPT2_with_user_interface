# Fine-tune_GPT2_with_user_interface

Now using this code anyone can fine-tune their GPT2 model without writing complex code.

## Acknowledgments:

 This code is inspired by [Dr. Sreenivas Bhattiprolu] DigitalSreenI Youtube tutorial video [Click Here](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=nsdCRVuprDY&t=754s&pp=ygURZ3B0IDIgZmluZSB0dW5pbmc%3D)
 
 I utilized their code to rectify some unwanted errors and create a more user-friendly interface, enabling anyone to use the code without encountering errors.
 
 Big thanks to [Dr. Sreenivas Bhattiprolu] DigitalSreenI for providing code publicly.

## Changes I Made:

 1) I added user interface mode that allow user to fine-tune their GPT2 model without learning or writing complex code. You just need to fill information and get your fine-tuned model easily.
 2) I removed pdf and word file from code because it sometimes show error. So in this code you can use txt format data for fine-tune but if you want to use pdf or word file you can add it manually.
 3) I also provided a sample data you can use that if you don't have already [ Sample data for only example purpose to show how you can add data. If you want desired results please use your dataset ]
 4) I also provided full guide to how you can use this code to fine-tune your GPT2 model.

## To open an issue:

1) Go to the "Issues" tab on this repository.
2) Click on the "New Issue" button.
3) Describe your question, problem, or feedback in detail.
 
## To use this code:
 Remember that you have heavy resource to fine-tune otherwise it takes long time or even not fine-tune. If you don't have you can use cloud type environment like aws, google colab etc.

 1) First step you must have necessary modules in your environment like Pytorch, Transformers, Accelerate to use this code. If you don't have please install them.
 2) Second step clone this repository.
 3) Run fine-tune.py
 4) Fill information [ Check the guide that I provided for understanding ]
 5) And now you can use your fine-tune model.
